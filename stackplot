player1 =[1,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,5]

player2 =[1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,7]

player3 =[1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,5]

5. we are giving the labels to the players

labels = [player1,player2,player3]

6.we are giving the colors to the players differnetly you can use  hex value also
colors = ['pink','grey','yellow']

use the stackplot  and add the labels and colors also

plt.stackplot(minutes,player1,player2,player3,labels = labels,colors = colors)

legend shows which color is specificy to which you can also write legend with the location like plt.legend(loc='upperight')
plt.legend()
